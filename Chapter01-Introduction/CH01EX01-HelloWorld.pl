#Type in the “Hello, world” program and get it to work! You may name it anything
#you wish, but a good name might be ex1-1, for simplicity, as it’s exercise 1
#in Chapter 1. This is a program that even an experienced programmer would write,
#mostly to test the setup of a system. If you can run this program, your perl is
#working.

print "Hello World";
